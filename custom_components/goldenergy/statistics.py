"""Import Goldenergy meter readings and invoices as long-term external statistics.

The API exposes a **cumulative meter index** per reading — m³ for gas, kWh for
electricity — not per-period totals, which is exactly what the Home Assistant
Energy dashboard wants. What it does *not* expose for a conventional meter is a
daily series: readings are roughly monthly and land days after the date they
carry.

A live ``total_increasing`` sensor would therefore attribute a whole month's
consumption to the poll hour. Instead the readings are imported as external
statistics timestamped at **local midnight**, with each reading's delta **spread
evenly over the days it covers** — one point per calendar day between two
readings. Dating the whole delta at the reading day put a month of consumption on
a single day, and since the dashboard diffs ``sum`` at month boundaries, a reading
taken on the 11th credited three weeks of the previous month to the current one.
An even split is an approximation, but a far smaller one.

The whole window is **rewritten** on every poll rather than appended to: the
running ``sum`` is anchored on the statistic already stored for the oldest reading
in the window and recomputed from there, so a backdated reading arriving late
repairs the days it covers instead of dumping them on the day it showed up.

Four series are published per billing account:

=====================================  =========  ==============================
Series                                 Unit       How it is maintained
=====================================  =========  ==============================
``gas_volume_<account>``               m³         window rewritten, source of truth
``gas_energy_<account>``               kWh        derived from volume x factor
``electricity_energy_<account>``       kWh        window rewritten, source of truth
``cost_<account>``                     currency   append-only, from invoices
=====================================  =========  ==============================

The gas energy series is *derived* rather than accumulated alongside the volume
one, so a corrected conversion factor repairs the whole history rather than only
its tail. The cost series is per account because one invoice bills every energy on
it; it carries what was actually invoiced (fixed terms and VAT included), which
Home Assistant needs as a statistic since it refuses a price entity on an external
statistic.

This algorithm is the one proven in the CUR Gás Natural integration.
